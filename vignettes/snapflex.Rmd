`snapflex` provides functions and templates for generating local flexdashboards showcasing and summarizing SNAP data sets as well as functions for accessing existing popular SNAP flexdashboards hosted online.

## Available templates

Before creating flexdashboards for SNAP climate data, it is necessary to know what flexdashboard templates are available. This can be done with `flex_templates`.

```{r templates}
library(snapflex)
flex_templates()
```

*The package is in early development so the list is scant at the moment.*

The table displays useful information about each template:


* the template ID used for generating a local flexdashboard.
* a brief description of the template.
* the variables included in the flexdashboard.
* whether any variables are displayed as deltas in comparison to a baseline rather than as raw values.
* intra- and/or inter-annual time period information if applicable.
* whether Shiny is used at runtime to launch a local instance of an interactive flexdashboard rather than a standalone html document.
* whether the template requires any additional parameters specified by the user.

## User specifications

Regarding the last item on the above list, some templates allow for limited user customization.
For example, a flexdashboard template for climate trends at a point location may require the user to provide a specific location from a list of available options so that the template can be used for more than a single, hard-coded location.
The row in `flex_templates()` pertaining to the `psc1` template for projected seasonal climate at a point location shows `TRUE` under the `params` column. This means that this template requires user-specified parameters.
Use `flex_params` with the template ID to see what is required.

```{r params}
flex_params(template = "psc1")
```

`flex_params` returns a list of two elements. The first is a vector of parameter names. In this case there is only one: location. Having this information makes it possible to now use this template with `flex`, which would return an error if any required parameter is not provided.
The second is a character string hint providing some context or description of what is considered a valid value for each parameter.

## Creating flexdashboards

The central function in `snapflex` that creates and populates flexdashboards from templates and SNAP climate data sets is `flex`.
Specify `out_dir` in `flex` if you want to save flexdashboards somewhere other than your working directory.

```{r flex}
pars <- list(location = "Anchorage")
flex(template = "psc1", template_params = pars)
```

This will create a flexdashboard using `rmarkdown` and save it to `out_dir`. Click the image to view the flexdashboard result.

Some templates use Shiny runtime and launch in your web browser as an app. For these templates, there is no static HTML document saved to `out_dir`.

Remember that `snapflex` is part of the [SNAPverse](https://leonawicz.github.io/snapverse/). It is for showcasing SNAP data sets. If using `snapflex` it is important to have a more general familiarity with the SNAPverse. Specifically, it is important in the example above to know that available point locations associated with SNAP climate data are part of the `snaplocs` package. `flex_params` provides this hint, but generally speaking, success using SNAPverse packages correlates with the level of familiarity you have with the verse and the SNAP data sets it wraps around.

## Development status

Future updates to `snapflex` will include an expanded array of SNAP flexdashboard templates.
